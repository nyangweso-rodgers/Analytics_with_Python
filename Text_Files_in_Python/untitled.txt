Real growth happens when you start working on real projects with real teams ........
increase your time in the best environment  for learning, working in teams.
// you want to sorround yourself in an environment where everybody is smarter than you and you are working everyday with them.
From there, be a sponge and absorb all the information.

// Make 2019 the year you took a risk, you learned a highly in demand skill, you were teriffied, you had new experiences and you received new opportunities. // Give it  a try!

// in order to learn anything of value, you need  to start with the foundation and develop the root of the tree.
// only from there will you  be able learn concepts and specific skills (leaves) that connect to the foundation
