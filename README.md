# Overview of Python
The python __source code__ is first compiled into __Byte Code__. Though Python is an __interpreted language__, it first gets compiled into __byte code__. This byte code is then interpreted and executed by the __Python Virtual Machine__.

This compilation and execution are what make Python slower than other low-level languages such as C/C++. In languages such as C/C++, the __source code__ is compiled into __binary code__ which can be directly executed by the CPU thus making their execution efficient than that of Python.
