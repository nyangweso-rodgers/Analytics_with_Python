## Unicode, UTF-8 and Strings in Python

1. __What are strings made of?__
In Python (2 or 3), __strings__ can either be represented in __bytes__ or __unicode code points__. 
__Byte__ is a unit of information that is built of __8 bits__ â€” _bytes are used to store all files in a hard disk_. So all of the CSVs and JSON files on your computer are built of bytes. We can all agree that we need bytes, but then what about unicode code points?
